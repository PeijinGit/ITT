It needs to be IT related. Our suggestion is that you donâ€™t challenge yourself with something you are completely unfamiliar with as you will have limited time to prepare. 
Your audience will be the technical lead of the professional services team. 
The area of training that you choose needs to highlight and showcase some technical skills that you have. 
You need to ensure that what you deliver is interactive so that as was the case with the previous scenario and interview with us, there is a sense of collaboration through the session.
