•	It needs to be IT related. Our suggestion is that you don’t challenge yourself with something you are completely unfamiliar with as you will have limited time to prepare. 
•	Your audience will be the technical lead of the professional services team. 
•	The area of training that you choose needs to highlight and showcase some technical skills that you have. 
•	You need to ensure that what you deliver is interactive so that as was the case with the previous scenario and interview with us, there is a sense of collaboration through the session. 
•	You should expect plenty of questions and interruptions!
•	You should aim for this to take around 45 minutes max. So you need to have enough breadth and depth to what you want to cover to allow a collaborative session for that sort of length. So to be clear, the 45 minutes will be the overall length – you should aim to be presenting material for a smaller period of time as the interactive and collaborative session we want to have will naturally use up a lot of the time. 
•	Our suggestion is that you pick an area that can ‘scale’ and can lead to other areas of discussion so we can comfortably fill the time and conversely don’t pick something so broad that can’t be adequately covered in the time available.
